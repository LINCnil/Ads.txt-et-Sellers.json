    <div class="bloc B2 M9 S9"> <h2> What are Ads.txt files?</h2> </div>
    <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">It all starts with the "inventory". Most of the
    websites you visit reserve one or more areas on their pages for displaying
    advertisement. For each web user who visits these pages, there is therefore
    a possible "impression" (i.e. display) of an advertisement in this space for
    that user. This “impression” constitutes an element of inventory sold by the
    publisher. <br><br> For example, for a website with 1 advertising space and
    1000 daily visitors, the site inventory is made up of 1000 impressions for
    sale per day.
    <br><br> The publisher will generally use the services of one or more SSPs (for
    <i>« <a target= "blank"
    href="https://linc.cnil.fr/les-encheres-en-temps-reel-rtb-un-systeme-complexe">
    supply-side platform</a> »</i>)to sell these impressions on an advertising
    exchange network (or <i>"ad exchange"</i>). Each of these SSPs is therefore
    authorised by the publisher to sell its inventory on a certain number of ad
    exchange networks, whether this SSP is directly integrated on the
    publisher's page or just a simple reseller. <br><br>
    <span>Those relationships are described in the Ads.txt files, with the aim
    of fighting against advertising fraud. <span> </div> </div>

    <div class="line"> <div class="bloc B2 M9 S9"> <h2>What types of fraud are publishers trying to avoid?</h2>

        </div> <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">

            Why do publishers voluntarily make the list of advertising companies
            they work with available to everyone? The aim is to avoid two types
            of fraud:

            <ul> <li>The first is quite simple: it is the usurpation of a publisher’s
            identity. Let's imagine that the SSP1 is selling the inventory of website A on
            an advertising exchange network. This website has a good reputation, and the
            inventory is selling well. SSP2 then decides to sell the inventory on the same
            network inventory of a website B, which is less valuable, by passing it off as
            the one from website A. The SSP2 can then sell its lower quality inventory at a
            higher price, which results in the authentic inventory being discounted (since
            prices are adjusted according to supply and demand). Ads.txt files allows all
            the actors in the ecosystem to check whether SSP2 is allowed to sell the
            inventory of website A and therefore preserving its value.
            </li> <li>The second is more subtle: it is the resale of inventory.
            Let's imagine that inventory from website A is sold on two different
            advertising exchange networks, the ADX1 and the ADX2. On the ADX1
            this inventory is sold for €1 per impression. On the ADX2 where
            there is less demand, it is sold for €0.50 per impression. An SSP
            can notice this variation and buy inventory onADX2 at a low price
            and resell it on ADX1 at a higher price. Although this practice is
            less fraudulent, it can lower the average profitability of the
            inventory, hence its prohibition. With the Ads.txt files it is
            possible to know that the SSP should not be able to resell this
            inventory. </li>

        </div> </div> <div class="line"> <div class="bloc B2 M9 S9"> <h2>
        Why do we care?</h2>

        </div> <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">

            Ads.txt files allow to identify the relationships between online
            advertising companies and website publishers. It is important to
            know that the players in this chain do not limit themselves to
            organising inventory sales. Each inventory item sold is associated
            with a unique identifier of the web user which is generally stored
            in a cookie. This identifier makes it possible to build advertising
            profiles of users, for example by tracing their browsing habits
            through the web. To better understand these practices, <a target=
            "blank" href="https://linc.cnil.fr/les-encheres-en-temps-reel-rtb-un-systeme-complexe">
            read the article (in French) on the RTB</a>, one of the most popular
            programmatic sales modalities.<br><br> <span>By visualising the
            prevalence of each player on the French Web, we can therefore get a
            good idea of the extent of the collection of browsing data by
            advertisers, as each advertising service generally uses cookies to
            track Internet users. </span> </div> </div>

            incomprehensible to users, since its precision and complexity cannot
            reasonably be understood by an ordinary user. As this system is
            based on the processing of data relating to individuals (generally
            cookie identifiers), it is essential that it can be understood and
