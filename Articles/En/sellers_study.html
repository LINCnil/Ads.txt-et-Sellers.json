    <div class="bloc B2 M9 S9"> <h2> What are the Sellers.json files?</h2>
    </div> <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">  As explained in our <a target= "blank"
    href="./ads_study.html">Ads.txt study</a>, publishers use services called SSP
    (for <i>"supply-side platform"</i>) to market inventory items (i.e. advertising
    impressions) on an ad exchange network. Each of these SSPs is therefore
    authorised by the publisher to sell inventory from its website on a certain
    number of ad exchanges, whether this SSP is directly integrated on the
    publisher's page or is external and therefore a simple reseller. Sometimes,
    an inventory item can pass through several SSPs in the chain to be sold,
    which is not described in the Ads.txt files. <br><br> <span>The Sellers.json
    file describes the commercial relations between the different SSPs and the
    publishers, making it possible to identify all the intermediaries during the
    sale of inventory. <span>
    </div> </div>

    <div class="line"> <div class="bloc B2 M9 S9"> <h2>What are the additional
    elements compared to Ads.txt?</h2>

        </div> <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">

            The types of frauds targeted by the Sellers.json file are quite
            similar to those targeted by Ads.txt (i.e. site usurpation and
            inventory resale), but this mechanism provides other tools to detect
            them. <br><br>Thus, it makes it possible: <ul> <li>For publishers to
            check that the sales channel of their inventory meets their
            expectations.</li> <li>For buyers to identify the third parties
            involved in the inventory sale, thus avoiding dubious actors.</li>
            <li>For third parties to detect, through inconsistencies between the
            Ads.txt and Sellers.json registers, potential fraud.</li> </ul>

        Why do we care?</h2>

        </div> <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">

            While Ads.txt files identify the relationships between online
            advertising companies and website publishers, Sellers.json files
            allow you to visualise the intermediary players involved in the sale
            of inventory. Each inventory item sold is associated with a unique
            identifier of the user, which is generally stored in a cookie. This
            identifier makes it possible to build advertising profiles of users,
            for example by tracing their browsing through the web. To better
            understand these practices, <a target= "blank"

            different advertising networks that take place when an item of

        players, if they list other SSP intermediaries, we add them to our list
        and carry on. Only files with a URL are considered valid.
        <br><br> This method enabled us to identify  <span>6017</span> SSP,
        present on <span>217 985</span> websites. <br><br> We crawled this

    typology that have links with the top 20 SSPs (these were identified during
    the study on Ads.txt). Using Sellers.json, we can see that these SSPs can
    declare relationships with 3 types of players: <ul> <li> publishers;</li>
    <li>intermediaries;</li> <li>mixed players, fulfilling both roles.</li>

    publishers. On average a SSP has relationships with
    <span> 671</span> publishers and <span> 72</span> intermediaries. There
    are of course exceptions to this rule. For example, a single SSP offers
